# employeeManagement

Hello, 
So, this is employee management system backend written in Java based Spring-boot framework.
Spring-boot is an amazing framework for:
1. writing code for complex and large projects.
2. it is based on creating microservices that are loosely coupled and maintainable.

this is a basic full stack project that includes CRUD operation to create, read, update, delete employees details from the database through a react based front-end.
I am currently working on this to add functionalities like:
1. employee search
2. login system for admin and employees.
 ..any other functionality to be added is appreciated .. just email/msg.
